DAY 4
TASKS :

1)Find outliers and fix or remove them. Mention the methods and explain how did you find the outliers. Also, give reason that why have you removed or fixed the values of the outliers.

2)Analyse each column with every other coulmn and find the relationship between the two columns. This can be done using various plots/graphs.

3)Find the correlation of PM2.5 with rest of the coulmns using correlation matrix and then visulaize the correlation matrix using heatmap.

4)Perform various plots like:- scatter plots, lm plots, bar plots, pie plots etc according to the values in the columns. Keep in mind that you don't need to plot every type of plots, plot only the ones you think are suitable for a column.

5)Plot box plot for every column and write your observations that you observed from the box plot.

6)Find how PM2.5 is getting affected by other coulmns.


TASK 1:
       --> For recognizing  outlier we used BOX_PLOTS and INTER_QUARTILE_RANGE method for removing them.
       
TASK 2:
       --> We used PAIR_PLOTS to visualize how each column correlates and varies with other column.
       
TASK 3:
       --> We used HEATMAPS to find correlation of "PM2.5" with other features.

TASK 4:
       --> We used HIST_PLOT to visualize each column independently.

TASK 5
       --> We used BOX_PLOTS to determine the range of values.

TASK 6 
       --> We used SCATTER_PLOT and LINE_PLOT to find how "PM2.5" varies with other features.
